# Online bayesian inference

The goal of this statistics project to understand and implement a recent article: *Perturbed Bayesian Inference for Online Parameter Estimation*, Gerber and Heine

gaussian_example and logistic_example provide examples of posterior distribution convergence speed computation.
Implementation_1 and Implementation_2 implements the algorithm from the article in dimension 1 or >1.
