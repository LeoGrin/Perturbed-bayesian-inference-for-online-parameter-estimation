The goal of this statistics project is
1) to get a better grasp of the theoritical foundations of bayesian parameter estimation through weekly summaries of *Statistical Estimation. Asymptotic Theory*, Ibargimov, Hasminskii
2) To understand and implement a recent article: *Perturbed Bayesian Inference for Online Parameter Estimation*, Gerber and Heine
